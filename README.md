# Supply-chain-analysis-with-excel

Supply chain analytics plays a crucial role in driving data-driven decision-making across industries, including manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics. In this report, I present an analysis of a Fashion and Beauty startup's supply chain data, specifically focused on the movement of makeup products. By collecting, analyzing, and interpreting this dataset, I aim to gain insights that can inform strategic decisions and optimize the supply chain operations.

The dataset comprises various features related to the fashion and makeup product supply chain. These features provide valuable information for understanding the flow of products from suppliers to customers. The following features are include:

1. Product Type
2. SKU
3. Price
4. Availability
5. Number of products sold
6. Revenue generated
7. Customer demographics
8. Stock levels
9. Lead times
10. Order quantities
11. Shipping times
12. Shipping carriers
13. Shipping costs
14. Supplier name
15. Location
16. Lead time
17. Production volumes
18. Manufacturing lead time
19. Manufacturing costs
20. Inspection results
21. Defect rates
22. Transportation modes
23. Routes
24. Costs
